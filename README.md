# Identifying Asymmetric and Symmetric Ties Among National Network of Local Health Departments
Contributors: Irum Javed, Jingye Wang, & Yiqiang Zhao
## Overview
The goal of this social network analysis is to utilize similar methods used in *[Communication Ties Across the National Network of Local Health Departments (Harris, 2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23415121)*. An understanding of how the national network of LHDs has changed since 2010 can assist policymakers and public health practioners in creating future strategies for developing an interconnected network. In addition, the information from the network analysis can be used to strengthen the flow of dissemination and implementation programming strategies between LDSs. As part of the social network analysis, a statistical model was developed to assess characteristics associated with strong and weak ties within a network of LHDs. 

## Methods
### Measures
Network analysis, descriptive, visual, and statistical network analyses were conducted.  
The baseline, null model was built using only the edges of the network as independent variable. Model 1 was used to predict only the asymmetric ties by adding the independent variables. Model 2 used the same variables as model 1 to predict both asymmetric ties and mutual ties.
### Software
Analyses were generated in R 3.3.2 using three packages: Igraph, Statnet, and ERGM.
